- struct opts - simultaneously both marshal/unmarshal
- containers
- identities / objgraphs
- 'auto-hierarchy' - default polymorphism tags
- 'auto-factory' - arg names / types correspond to fields
    - correlate with getters
- single mut lock, copy on write, update all at once
- register warming types
- case folding impl on ctxs
- type-switched polymorphic - if only impls are a userstring and userint
